This collection is designed to help you work with small-scale fishery data using R. The examples are tailored to practical use cases, leveraging `ggplot2` and other tools to analyze and visualize fisheries data. All code can be run interactively in your browser using `quarto-live`, meaning no installation is necessary to start learning and applying these techniques.

These data science "snacks" are meant to provide you with hands-on experience for working with real-world fishery datasets. They can serve as quick, practical insights or as stepping stones to more advanced analysis in fisheries research.
