## Introduction to ggplot2

In this short guide, we'll explore how to use `ggplot2` to create visualizations using the `cars` dataset. This dataset contains the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop.

### Basic Scatter Plot

Let's start with a simple scatter plot of speed versus stopping distance:

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
library(ggplot2)

# Load the cars dataset
data(cars)

# Basic scatter plot with ggplot2
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Speed vs Stopping Distance",
       x = "Speed (mph)",
       y = "Stopping Distance (ft)")
```

### Adding a Smoothing Line

We can add a trend line to the scatter plot to visualize the relationship between speed and stopping distance.

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Speed vs Stopping Distance with Trend Line",
       x = "Speed (mph)",
       y = "Stopping Distance (ft)")
```

### Customizing the Plot

Finally, let's customize the colors and theme of the plot.
```{webr}
#| autorun: false
ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Customized Speed vs Stopping Distance",
       x = "Speed (mph)",
       y = "Stopping Distance (ft)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
