We’ll use the {nanoparquet} package to get some info on the file. We can get an idea of the size of the data using parquet_info():\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s get info about the column types in our file with parquet_column_types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, nanoparquet is very useful for reading and writing parquet files. But remember, we are going to be interacting with the files through a database query engine. Enter DuckDB."

    "text": "Querying your Data\nTo actually interact with the data, we can connect to the parquet file with the DuckDB package. We first need to start what’s called a database connection so that we can connect to the DuckDB software:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we’re going to make a “View”, which is a temporary table in DuckDB to do our queries on. This also connects our parquet file into DuckDB with the PARQUET_SCAN() function in DuckDB.\nThis is the only SQL we need to write to interact with the data. The rest we can do with dplyr commands thanks to a package called duckplyr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we have our connection and our view, we can start to take a look at the data. We can pass our connection and view with the tbl() function. Here we’re calling head(), followed by collect().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we need to call collect()? DuckDB uses what’s called Lazy Execution: it only calculates a value when you tell it to. Lazy Execution allows DuckDB to make an execution plan: it finds the best strategy for executing the entire query rather than calculate it piece by piece."
